# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-PA
### This repository contains the files needed for completing the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course from Coursera. The R script "run_analysis.R" will perform the following:
* 1: Check if you already have the required files, otherwise download them
* 2: Unpack the files and read them into R
* 3: Load the descriptive data on subjects, activities and the variable names
* 4: Load test and train data and create nice structure
* 5: Merge the datasets and put everything into the same structure
* 6: Group the data and calculate means
* 7: Write the finalised table into a text file called "tidy.txt"
